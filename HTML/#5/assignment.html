        <p>
            Born in Maida Vale, London, Turing was raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_England">southern England</a>. He graduated at King's College, Cambridge, with a degree in mathematics. Whilst he was a fellow at Cambridge, he published a proof demonstrating that some purely mathematical yesâ€“no questions can never be answered by computation and defined a Turing machine, and went on to prove the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable
